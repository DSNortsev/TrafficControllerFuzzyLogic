# Intelligent Traffic Controller Using Fuzzy Logic

The purpose of this project is to address the design and implementation of an intelligent traffic light system based on fuzzy logic technology. Using Python, a fuzzy logic system has been developed to determine the wait time of a typical traffic junction. The problem is highly graphical in nature and simulates traffic conditions of an intersection with the intention to increase or mitigate when needed based off certain conditions.
