# TrafficControllerFuzzyLogic
The purpose of this project is to address the design and implementation of an intelligent traffic light system based on fuzzy logic technology. Using Python, a fuzzy logic system has been developed to determine the wait time of a typical traffic junction. The problem is highly graphical in nature and simulates traffic conditions of an intersection with the intention to increase or mitigate when needed based off certain conditions.
